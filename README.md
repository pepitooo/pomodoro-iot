# What ?

From a unformal meeting on saturday evening front of few beers we decide to do a IOT challenge. We came with the idea to do a ![pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

# With what ?

I decide to choose the hardware for it. It will be base on some standard ESP-2866 (can be program like an arduino but with wifi built in).

I choose from a chinese website the ![Esp8266 Witty](http://www.schatenseite.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/160422_witty_cloud_01-1-350x271.jpg), because there is already some sensor and led
- light sensor
- button
- led
- RGB led

Then to display easily the remaning time I choose a ![NeoPixel Ring](http://a.pololu-files.com/picture/0J5446.600x480.jpg)  module with 24 rgb leds.

# Next steps ?


1. Write specs for standalone mode
2. Write specs for connected mode
3. Wait until the hardware arrived from china
4. Learn and try with the hardware
